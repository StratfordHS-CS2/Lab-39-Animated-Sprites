# Lab 39 - Animated Sprites

You will be making a scene with several animated sprites, one of which will be controlled by the user.

### Requirements

1. Create at least 2 sprites.  One is controlled by the user (keyboard or mouse), the other can be stationary or moving on its own.
2. Each sprite should be an instance of its own class with its own update() and draw() methods.
3. Make the animation run at a reasonable rate by controlling the speed of the animation, not by changing the FPS of your program.
4. You may use the images provided, or you may find your own.

These are examples of various Pygame things we have done, including the animation we did in class.
